# VSCode problem - terminal error with conda

Opening User Preferences (JSON)

Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + P: This opens the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code. The Command Palette allows you to access various commands and settings in VS Code quickly.
Once the Command Palette is open, you can type in commands. In this case, typing Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON) opens the user settings as a JSON file. This allows you to edit the settings directly in the JSON format, which provides more control and flexibility than the standard settings interface.
terminal.integrated.inheritEnv Setting
In the settings file (either the standard interface or the JSON version), the setting "terminal.integrated.inheritEnv": true can be added.
What this setting does:
It ensures that the integrated terminal in VS Code inherits the environment variables of the shell or system from which VS Code was launched.
If disabled (false), the terminal won't inherit any system environment variables, which can cause issues when trying to run commands that rely on specific environment settings.
By enabling this setting, it resolves issues where the terminal may not recognize certain paths, environment variables, or dependencies needed for development.



crtl + shift + p    
preferences: open user preferences (json)

I resolved that issue by enabling terminal.integrated.inheritEnv in VScode setting.

"terminal.integrated.inheritEnv": true
